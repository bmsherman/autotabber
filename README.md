AutoTabber
==========

AutoTabber generates optimal guitar tablature from MIDI files describing guitar pieces.

AutoTabber is a command-line utility written in Haskell. It uses the Haskell music library [Euterpea](https://github.com/dwincort/Euterpea) to import and read MIDI files.

Additional documentation is available in the file *Overview.pdf*. This describes:
 - Features, settings, and usage
 - Examples
 - The strategies used to describe "optimal" tablature
 - The algorithms which compute optimal tablatures
 - Details of how the program is implemented

AutoTabber was created by Ben Sherman as a project for the Yale class [CPSC 431/531: Algorithmic Computer Music](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/cpsc-431-531/) taught by Professor Paul Hudak.
